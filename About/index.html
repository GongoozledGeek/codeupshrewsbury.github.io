    <div class="about">
        <p>
            CodeUp Shrewsbury is for quite literally anyone and everyone. If you want to get into coding, but don’t know
            where to start, come along for a coffee and we can buddy you up with someone who knows their stuff, or you
            can listen or join in with any group chats we think would be useful for you. Even if you're an experienced
            dev and want to bounce ideas of someone else, there's a place for you. It's kind of like Stack overflow, but
            with real people.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            We operate a learner-led drop in basis so there’s no set agenda or workshop leader - just a group of
            learners and mentors. Think about the kind of thing that interests you and that you might like to learn more
            about, or if you’re an experienced dev please consider sharing whatever projects you’re working on at the
            moment or have worked on in the past.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            The CodeUp sessions are also suitable for people with basic skills who need support to develop them, and
            even for people with intermediate or advanced skills who just want to come along to a space where everyone
            is immersed in code!
            <br/>
            <br/>

            What do I need to bring with me?
            Bring your laptop if you have one (don't worry if you don't have anything installed you think yo might need,
            we can help you get the right stuff installed to get you going).
            That's about it, but hunger to learn wouldn't hurt either!
            <br/>
            <br/>

            We look forward to seeing you there and if you have any questions before hand, drop us a message on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CodeUp-Shrewsbury/">Meetup</a> or
            via our <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeupShrews">Twitter</a>
